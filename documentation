Debouncing an input (search for a movie)
    -waiting for sometime to pass after the last event to actually do something.

Issues to tackle:
    1) Fix broken images.
    2) Clear the drop down when user types a new input.
    3) dropdown menu should clear when user click anywhere outside the dropdown box.

How did we fix issue number 3:
    every node/element in html is associated with a number $0, $1, $2 etc.,
    we can check if these elements are present in the document with document.contains($0), it returns true if present else it returns false
    we can check all the click events and if the click is not contained in rootDiv we can make the dropdown element class in-active.
    That way whenever a click is made outside the dropdown it can be collapsed.

Issues with codebase after making all the functionlities work
    1) All touches everything (meaning changes are made all over the place in auto complete widget)
        To overcome this autocomplete widget was supposed to be reusable.
    2) Auto complete has knowledge of what a movie object is(if we use this code for cooking recipie we need to make changes to all the movie properties)
    3) Auto complete has knowledge of what to show for each option.
    4) Auto complete has knowledge of what to do when a movie is clicked
    5) Many global variables that refer to specific elements - it will be really hard to show a second auto complete on the screen

Non-reusable code 

index.js
config for autocomplete.js
    fetchData() function to find movies
    renderOption() function that know how to render movie
    onOptionSelect() function that gets invoked when a user clicks an option
    root - element that the autocomplete should be rendered into

autocomplete.js
    function that wil take the autocomplete config and render an autocomplete on the screen
