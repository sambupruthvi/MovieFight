Debouncing an input (search for a movie)
    -waiting for sometime to pass after the last event to actually do something.

Issues to tackle:
    1) Fix broken images.
    2) Clear the drop down when user types a new input.
    3) dropdown menu should clear when user click anywhere outside the dropdown box.

How did we fix issue number 3:
    every node/element in html is associated with a number $0, $1, $2 etc.,
    we can check if these elements are present in the document with document.contains($0), it returns true if present else it returns false
    we can check all the click events and if the click is not contained in rootDiv we can make the dropdown element class in-active.
    That way whenever a click is made outside the dropdown it can be collapsed.
